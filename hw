CS360 Spring 2024
File System Homework
Due Saturday May 11 by 9am
Will not be accepted late. To hand in, submit a PDF to Moodle. The PDF should be named
username.hw4.pdf, e.g., meehean_j.hw4.pdf.
Answer all of the questions in your own words; I already know what the book says.
1. Program P1 needs to read 10MBs sequentially from an inner track of the hard disk
drive. Program P2 needs to read 10MBs sequentially from an outer track. Which
approach would result in the least amount of overhead: (a) do all of P1’s reads
first, then P2’s; (b) handle P1’s and P2’s requests as they arrive (intermingled); (c) it
does not matter? Explain.
2. What are the advantages/disadvantages of Nearest Block scheduling?
3. How does the Fast File System treat large files differently? Why?
4. Explain why a journal write (consisting of TxB, metadata, and data) is a separate
operation from a journal commit. Why not do both operations simultaneously?
5. What additional write ordering does metadata journaling require that data
journaling does not? Why?
